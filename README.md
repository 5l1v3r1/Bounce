# Bounce
Bounce pings an address with 1 packet every 10 seconds by default. If you want shorter/longer ping periods, set the sleep.time(10) to the amount of seconds you want. If you want to send more than one packet at a time, change the response "1" to your own number then change the subprocess call in the while statement to the same number.

Install:
1. clone or download the package
